The team builds on what has been created in the previous platforms implemented (for example: the code, the procedures for organizing, the methodology of development and communication) and elaborates other ideas. The result is what you see: the work of a collective intelligence, which you can also call **civic hacking**.

**What is civic hacking? What method and approach do you use?**

There is a problem that affects the community. A small piece of this collectivity starts to find, propose and offer solutions, in a voluntary and open way and using the possibilities offered by the Internet and open source digital technologies. That's civic hacking in a nutshell. It is collective intelligence at work. In an emergency, for example, we are overwhelmed by information and we don't really know where to find it, how to report it. Our project is one possible solution.

The approach we use we've called **AGOPENDI**: **AG**gregate, **OPEN**, **DI**stribute. 

Meaning:

**Aggregate **contents**.** Contents are unstructured and come from various sources (social media, email, contacts etc...). The platform aggregates them through manual work of moderation and structuring in order to give them a "standard" structure and make them effectively reusable data.

**Open **data**.** All data are public and accessible with free licenses. Open data allows the development of further information and service that is fairly easily released.

**Distribute** information. All open data can easily become new useful information. There are several ways to do it. You can give free rein to your imagination, but always looking for tools that are used or can be simply disseminated. For example, this project has a site, a Twitter profile, a Facebook group, a Telegram group from which anyone can share individual reports.

All of this can be reused in the future and improved and everyone can help in doing that!

Thank you for reading this far!
